    "Dask is a popular python library for parallel computing. It is designed to integrate easily with existing python code and other common libraries like Numpy and Pandas. During this introductory tutorial you will get to know some fundamental Dask functions, like dask.delayed and dask.dataframe, and workflows. There will also be some hands-on coding exercises for you to practice your newfound Dask knowledge. \n",
